                    <p>
                        My name is Coach and I want to get real with you for a minute.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’ve always dreamed big, wanted to make something of my life, and deeply cared about people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, as a kid I suffered emotionally in a major way. I always felt like the dumbest person in class.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was tall, skinny, goofy looking, constantly made fun of and never felt I had any real friends until later in high school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Reading was a major challenge for me. I couldn’t comprehend and read out loud what I saw in books. I was in the bottom of my class academically, insecure, and looking for ways to fit in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There were many moments I didn’t understand why I was born; I was bullied, picked last in sports, and experienced constant tension at home.

                    <p>
                        My parents got divorced, my brother did jail time for 4 years, I was sexually abused by a man when I was 5, and remember many times saying to school teachers, principals and my parents that I wish I were dead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our mind and emotions play tricks on us when we feel we have no purpose or vision, community or contribution in life. And when I started seeking information and inspiration on how to create a better life for myself, that’s when everything started to change
                        for the better.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I put all of this negative and lonely energy into my dream of being a professional athlete, and one day, an Olympian. I went on to play Arena Football for one season, but a career ending injury shattered my identity. I didn’t know who I was without sports.
                    </p>
                    <p>You are love. The Coach</p>
